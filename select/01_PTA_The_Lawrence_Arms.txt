Don't worry, baby, it's nigh
The end of our time, the brush on your thigh
The feeling of toiling and loving
Only to watch it all die
I'm a long time a-coming, I'm coming along for one hell of a ride

We took planes, we took trains, we took automobiles
And it was still just me looking at you when we stopped spinning the wheels
Dusty and lonesome and craving a glance
That starts in your heart and shoots into your pants (whoo!)

So what did we do about it?
The same thing that everyone does
Cancel the contract you had with your soul
And cut out the love

'Cause if you're fighting yourself
No one is fighting for you
But baby, that's how I like it
I wanna be down there with you
I wanna be down there with you
I wanna be down there with you

We took planes, we took trains, we took automobiles
And it was still just me looking at you when we stopped spinning the wheels
Dusty and lonesome and craving a glance
Remember? We used to hold hands

Remember? We used to hold hands
Now, I just go out alone when I need to dance
